  <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: cursive;">An unforgettable story of love, hope and betrayal, and a testament to the courage of humanity in history’s darkest days.
    As Nazis occupy his beloved city, Professor Josef Held feels helpless. So when he discovers his former pupil Michael Blum is trying to escape the Gestapo, he offers Michael a place to hide in his attic.
    In the quiet gloom of the secret room, Michael talks of his beautiful, fearless girlfriend, Elke. Michael insists that not even the Nazis will come between them. But Elke is a non-Jewish Dutch girl, and their relationship is strictly forbidden.
    Josef sees the passionate determination in his young friend’s eyes. Furious with the rules of the cruel German soldiers and remembering his own heartbreak, Josef feels desperate to give Michael and Elke’s love a chance. But then tragedy strikes, and Josef is faced with an impossible choice.
    In the dark days of war, with danger and betrayal at every turn, no-one can be trusted. If Michael is to survive and get back to the woman he loves, it will be down to Josef – to find the hero inside himself, and do whatever it takes to keep Michael alive.
    Even if it means putting his own life in mortal danger.
    A heartbreakingly beautiful story about courage against the odds, perfect for fans of The Tattooist of Auschwitz, All The Light We Cannot See, and The Nightingale.
    
    I don’t think this has been my year for historical fiction, first the nightmare that was Nineteen Steps and now A View Across the Rooftops. It’s a little unfair of me to compare the two, because this was inherently bad, I just think it missed the mark. There was so much that could have been done and focused on and instead it felt jumpy and incohesive.</p>
